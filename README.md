# -Utility-Unlocker-LH4-v2-Unlocker
This modification can be installed on NVIDIA's entire GeForce RTX lineup based on the Ampere GPU architecture including the GeForce RTX 30 LHR series and the RTX Workstation graphics cards. The report alleges that the tool can unlock the full mining performance of all cards &amp; the performance measurement can be seen below:  Supported RTX Ampere models and their performance  RTX 3060 LHR V2 – up to 49 MH/s RTX 3060 Ti LHR – up to 61 MH/s RTX 3070 LHR – up to 57 MH/s RTX 3070 Ti – up to 69 MH/s RTX 3080 LHR – up to 100 MH/s RTX 3080 Ti – up to 115 MH/s RTX A2000 – up to 46 MH/s RTX A4000 – up to 67 MH/s RTX A4500 – not measured RTX A5000 – up to 110 MH/s The first fully automated BIOS modifier for RTX cards with LHR v2 lock. Using it is simple, intuitive and requires no advanced knowledge.  It enables the modification of previously read BIOS files (using HiveOs or other mining OS) and reading the BIOS from the graphics card installed in the system, then automatic backup, file modification and flash memory using the modified BIOS.  In addition, it also modifies files in RTX Axxxx series cards, increasing their performance. At the moment, no integration with more modern Nvidia graphics cards is planned.
